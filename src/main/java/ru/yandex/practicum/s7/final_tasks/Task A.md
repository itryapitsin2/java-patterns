# The Levenshtein distance

The Levenshtein distance between two lines s and
t is the number of atomic changes that can be used to transform one row into another. Atomic changes mean: deleting one character, inserting one character, replacing one character with another.

Find the Levenshtein distance for the proposed pair of strings.

Print a single number â€” the distance between the lines.

Input format

The first line contains the string s, and the second line contains the string t. The lengths of both lines do not exceed 1000. The strings consist of small Latin letters.
