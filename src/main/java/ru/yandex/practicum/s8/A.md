# Line break

In some languages, sentences are written and read from right to left rather than left to right.

You have come across a strange textâ€”the letters in the words are in the usual order (left to right), but the words themselves are written in the opposite direction. You need to convert the text so that the words are written from left to right.

## Input 
The input consists of a string of words separated by spaces (one space between adjacent words). 
There are no more than $1000$ words in total, each of which is between $1$ and $100$ characters long. 
The words consist of lowercase letters of the English alphabet.

## Output
Output the string with the words in reverse order.

### Example
| Input                      | Output                    |
|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| one two three              | three two one             |
| hello                      | hello                     |
| may the force be with you  | you with be force the may |
